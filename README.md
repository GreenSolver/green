# GREEN

The Green solver provides a universal interface to a range of SAT/SMT decision procedures, constraint solvers, model counters, and related tools. Queries are reduced, reused, and recycled by built-in routines that provide simplification and persistence. 

The Green philosophy is simple: queries are **reduced** by simplification, **reused** by canonization, and **recycled** by caching their results and intermediate computations in a shared database.
