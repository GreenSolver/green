#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

When a client creates an instance of Green is created, a configuration can be passed to describe the behaviour of the instance.

= Setting the task manager =

{{{
green.taskmanager = <classname>
}}}

= Setting up services =

Green can be configure with any number of services.  An initial setting determines the initial list of services:

{{{
green.services = service1, service2, service3 ...
}}}

If a service `serv' has been configured, and an instance `inst' has been created, users can invoke the service by calling

{{{
Object r = inst.request("serv");
}}}

The `request' method returns an `java.lang.Object', the exact nature of which depends on the service.  For example, for a satisfiability service, a typical invocation might be

{{{
Boolean issat = (Boolean) inst.request("sat");
}}}
